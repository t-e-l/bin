-> Intro:
TEL is derived of the linux terminal environment app Termux.
The main difference is: TEL is designed and configured as a launcher / homescreen replacement and is bundled with custom applets and scripts to make it more useful as such.

Use of TEL is not recommended for those without prior knowledge of the linux terminal or termux app.
More information can be found at the TEL github / Wiki page @ https://t-e-l.github.io

-> Useful info:
termux-setup-storage command should be ran to link your phones memory with TEL's storage. It is not required but is used by several features.

If you want to hide the status bar, use key combo 'ALT + i' to toggle it on/off.

You can read the existing alias file at: ~/.aliases


-> Customisation:
TEL user settings are availible in ~/.tel/configs/

You can customise your status bar by adding / removing / editing the scripts in ~/.tel/status
Change status bar behaviour by editing the config file ~/.tel/configs/status.sh

You can edit motd (startup message) at ~/../usr/etc/motd

add your own aliases and functions into ~/storage/shared/tel/tel_personal.sh, this file will persist across updates / wipes of tel app.

You can add your own keybindings in ~/.tmux.conf

-> Troubleshooting:
We encourage reporting of errors through github, however please confirm the issue is not of user origin. Time spent advising user error is time that could be spent furthering the project!

Only use TEL plugins from the offical github, any termux plugins from elsewhere are likely to cause issues.
Make sure you have the TEL API addon downloaded from TEL git page.

The TEL API is slightly different from the Termux API although it will appear under "Termux API" in installed apps list.
If your experiencing issues you	can try changing settings in the ~/.tel/configs/ folder. Issues may vary upon how your device vendor handles battery saving behavior, if you think this is causing issues you can temporarily disable power saving settings \ optimisation for TEL and API, in the android app settings. You are unlikely to need to grant TEL extra permissions but it is a good thing to check if experiencing issues. Don't forget to use 'tel-restart' fully to see changes.

If you wish to start completely fresh (WARNING: will remove user files also) clear TEL app cache and storage via android settings, then uninstall TEL App and all TEL/Termux plugin apps. Make sure ALL Termux related apps and plugins are completely removed before redownloading the latest version of TEL app, opening and running tel-setup.
